My daughter, who tends to be a little withdrawn, is comfortable with and likes her mentor. Our mentor emails their work to me and sometimes sends my daughter other practice work she can do. It’s been such a lifesaver during this unchartered time and I’m so grateful for the help. Thank you to our mentor and CovEd!”",

My son’s eyes light up every time his brothers call him a scientist, this tutoring has simultaneously sparked a love for science and self confidence for my son. I did not think my son would be able to stay on a Zoom call for more than 30 minutes, but our mentor keeps him engaged and the time passes until I have to remind them when it gets to almost an hour.  Our mentor is patient and skilled at breaking down complex information. The experiments with the mentor has been the highlight of my son’s week, and my son is sure that they will come up with a cure with COVID-19 together. My heart is filled with thankfulness to you and the program because seeing my son enjoy learning and connect to someone intellectually is such a gift.”",

We get together twice a week–I help her with biology, math, and English while she teaches me about astronomy in return. I’ve been so inspired by her sense of curiosity and constant pursuit of new knowledge. Her family just immigrated to the United States a few years ago, and they’re grateful for the support provided by CovEd during this time. I’m excited to get to know her even better as we continue to learn from each other!”",
